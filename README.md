# Nereo Material Demo

This project is sample code to demonstrate both, how to use and how it looks the [Nereo Material library](https://github.com/nereolopez/nereo-material).

## Check it locally

If you want to see it running locally follow the steps below: 
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using the `npm install` command from the terminal.
3. Serve it locally by running `ng serve`. 
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

As you might have guessed, this is a regular Angular application. Within the `app` folder you will see a demo component for each of the available components in Nereo Material library. For instance, to see how to use the Contextual Toolbar, you can check the `contextual-toolbar-demo` component.

## Live Demo

If you want to see it live instead, you can just check the code in this repo, and see the demo application [here](https://nereo-material-demo.firebaseapp.com/home).
